## Usage

The models and scripts in this repository should be used with the FEMM program: http://www.femm.info

The octave FEMM scripts were developed under MATLAB and linux. As such, they were addapted from the octave examples (they won't run in octave due to minor syntatic differences). See http://www.femm.info/wiki/linuxsupport.

To run femm with MATLAB on linux, use the openfemm file in this folder instead of the one provided by the octave femm package.
